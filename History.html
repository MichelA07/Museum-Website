            Museum is a place and an institution that collects, takes care and interprets objects, artifacts, and other material evidence of human history, 
            as well as of nature, and makes them available for viewing by the general public. The word “museum” comes from the Ancient Greek “mouseion,” which meant 
            “seat of Muses,” and it was used as a philosophical institution or a place for contemplation. In Rome, the Latin word “museum” was used for places for philosophical 
            discussions. The first time the word “museum” was used to describe something similar to a modern museum was in the 15th century for the collection of Lorenzo de Medici 
            in Florence. Until the 17th century, it was a name for curiosities such as Ole Worm's collection in Copenhagen and John Tradescant's collection in Lambeth. When John 
            Tradescant's collection became the property of Elias Ashmole in 1677, it was moved to the University of Oxford to a building specially built for it. The building was 
            opened to the public in 1683 and was named the Ashmolean Museum and is considered the first museum open to the public that held the name “museum”. That marks the moment
            when “museum” started being an institution and not just a collection of items, and it remained like that during the 19th and 20th centuries. </p>

            In time some other forms of museums began to appear as they began to accommodate different types of artifacts. There are now open-air museums that have preserved buildings 
            as objects, ecomuseums, and even virtual museums that exist only in electronic form on the Internet. There are also archeology museums that hold archaeological artifacts; 
            art museums (or art galleries) that display different forms of art; encyclopedic museums that give much different information about local and global history; history museums; 
            maritime, military, and war museums; pop-up museums that are temporary and many more.
